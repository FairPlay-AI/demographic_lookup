PROJECT: demographic_lookup

PURPOSE:

This is a very simple-minded blob of code which estimates the racial
and ethnic probabilities associated with surnames and gender
probabilities associated with first names. It is typically used as
part of the CFPB implementation of Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding
(BISG) for racial and ethnic classification or its parallel for gender
imputation.

USAGE:

python3 name-lookup.py < tests/invalid_column_test

./name-lookup [input filename]

computes probabilities corresponding to names from the specified input file.

Alternatively

./name-lookup.py < <input file>

computes probabilites corresponding to names from standard input.
